Demo project README.

## Project Improvements
- Converted a simple idea into a **complete project structure** with clear folders (`src/`, `data/`, `output/`, `screenshots/`).
- Replaced plain theory with a **working CLI tool** that generates real crop and eco-fertilizer recommendations.
- Added **sample dataset and auto-generated output CSV** to demonstrate the working system.
- Created a **screenshot of console output** for quick verification without needing to run the program.
- Made the project **lightweight (no heavy ML packages)** but extendable for future AI/ML models.
- Wrote a detailed **README with usage steps, features, and license** for GitHub readiness.
